# pyBlockchain: A Simple Python Blockchain Implementation

## Overview

`blockchain.py` is a Python implementation of a simple blockchain. This project demonstrates the basic concepts of blockchain technology, including blocks, transactions, proof of work, and consensus mechanisms.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: Create new blocks and add them to the blockchain.
- **Proof of Work**: Implement a simple proof of work algorithm to secure the blockchain.
- **Transaction Handling**: Add and manage transactions within blocks.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Ensure all nodes in the network agree on the blockchain state.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain.py.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd pyBlockchain
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the blockchain script:
    ```sh
    python blockchain.py
    ```

2. The script will start a simple blockchain and allow you to interact with it through the command line.

## Interacting with our Blockchain

- You can use plain old cURL or Postman to interact with our API over a network.
